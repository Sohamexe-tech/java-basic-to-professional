This is a simple Java mini project built to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The project includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and uses Java collections, exception handling, and file handling. It serves as a beginner-friendly example for understanding how to structure and implement small-scale Java applications.
